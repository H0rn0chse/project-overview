## Usage
You can **add** new Projects and **update** your already added ones. The **search** looks for all phrases entered in some fields (`title`, `description` and `tags`). Since the localStorage might be cleared eventually by your browser you have the possibility to `import` and `export` your list and settings. You can also disable the **export reminder** in the settings. You can mark your **favorites** which will always land on top of the search. The **description** can handle markdown notation. By clicking on the **icons** you have quick access to your project assets.

## Customizations
You can only add new types but nbot edit and remove the default ones. Have a look at this [config](./assets/config.json) for examples.
